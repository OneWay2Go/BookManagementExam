1. There are 6 principles in REST. Client-Server architecture, Statelessness, Code-on-demand and so on. 
Statelessness is having enough info in incoming request.

2. Structure of Http request contains two sections. Header and Body.(I think)

3. Idompotency is giving same answer for replaying (a lot of same requests i mean) requests.

4. Middleware is working on other pipeline(request pipeline or smth like that), while filters are working on action pipeline. Also middlewares
are working globally, but filters can work locally too.

5. I think that by using FluentValidation your code is going to be more clear and you have more control because you can validate variables with
custom methods.
